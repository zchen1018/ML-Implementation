##### Implementation of Some Machine Learning Algorithms

1. Naive Bayes Classifier

A Python implementation of discrete variable Naive Classifier intended for binary classification problems.

2. The Tree Augmented Network (TAN)

Learn a tree structure to augment the edges of a naive Bayes network. The implementation uses Prim's algorithm to find the Maximum Weight Spanning Tree
